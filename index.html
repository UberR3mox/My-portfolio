            Meet the Mind Behind the Pixels : Hettal Adel</h2>
        <p>Hey there, I'm Hettal Adel, a 20-year-old UMBB  second year computer science engineering Student who is a Full Stack Developer and Designer with an unwavering passion for web design and development. My journey into the digital world started with a curious mind and a dream to create online experiences that break barriers.

            It all began when I got my hands on my first computer – a portal to a world of endless possibilities. As I navigated the web, I was mesmerized by the diverse websites and platforms that blended creativity with connectivity.
            
            This fascination led me to dive into the world of web design. The idea of transforming visual concepts into functional digital spaces intrigued me. Learning HTML and CSS, I started crafting personal websites and customizing online profiles. With every line of code, I felt the power of turning ideas into reality in the virtual realm.
            
            But my journey didn't stop there. My passion evolved into web development. I was drawn to the challenge of not just designing appearances but bringing them to life. Mastering programming languages like JavaScript, I delved into writing code, debugging issues, and solving problems – each challenge driving my skills to new heights.
            
            Venturing into freelance projects, I began crafting websites for small businesses and personal ventures. Witnessing the impact of my creations was immensely gratifying. The lines of code I typed became narratives woven into the digital tapestry.
            
            Engaging with online communities, I found a space to both share my knowledge and learn from others. This collaborative environment fueled my passion, propelling me to constantly refine my craft.
            
            Today, I'm both a designer and developer, crafting seamless user interfaces and robust backend systems. My commitment lies in delivering digital experiences that captivate and engage.
            
            My online presence is more than a portfolio – it's a testament to my journey. Through blogs, social media, and personal projects, I aim to inspire and spark curiosity, just as I was inspired years ago.
            
            Join me as I explore the boundless horizons of web design and development. Let's create digital marvels, push our boundaries, and celebrate the ever-evolving landscape of the internet. <br>
            
            Here's to the future where code and creativity intertwine. </p>
